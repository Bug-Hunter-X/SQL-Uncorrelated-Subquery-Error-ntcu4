To fix this issue, we need to correlate the subquery to the outer query. This means that the subquery should be executed for each row in the outer query.  We can achieve this by adding a condition to the subquery that depends on the outer query:

The following query demonstrates the corrected approach, using a correlated subquery to calculate the average salary of employees earning less than or equal to a given employee's salary. The outer query then filters on this conditional average.  Note that this isn't necessarily the 'best' approach in terms of performance, as it will execute a subquery for each row in the outer query:

```sql
SELECT e1.* 
FROM employees e1 
WHERE e1.salary > (SELECT AVG(e2.salary) FROM employees e2 WHERE e2.salary <= e1.salary); 
```

Alternatively, for better performance, consider using window functions:
```sql
SELECT * 
FROM (SELECT *, AVG(salary) OVER (ORDER BY salary) as running_avg FROM employees) as subquery
WHERE salary > running_avg; 
```
This version is much more efficient, calculating a running average which is then used to filter the employee records.

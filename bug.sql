The following SQL query uses a subquery that is not correlated to the outer query. This can lead to unexpected results, as the subquery will be executed only once, and its result will be used in all iterations of the outer query.  This is often unintended and can cause errors:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE salary > (SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees);
```

In this example, the subquery `(SELECT AVG(salary) FROM employees)` calculates the average salary of all employees only once.  Then the outer query compares each employee's salary to *that same single average*, rather than recalculating the average for each comparison.

The problem becomes particularly insidious with larger datasets where the average may not be representative of different subgroups within the data, leading to incorrect filtering.
